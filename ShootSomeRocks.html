<p>ShootSomeRocks is a game I made while developing my Java game engine. It does sprite rotation/scaling, pixel-perfect collosion detection, and audio sample generation and mixing all in software.
<br>
<p><i>Directions: </i>Use mouse to aim, click where you want the ship to go, and press space to shoot. Collect the power-up to increase firepower. As the level increases, more enemies are added to make it harder. There are 64 levels.
<p><i>Pro Tip: </i>You only have to get all the rocks to proceed. Sometimes you can use this to your advantage.
